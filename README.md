Working to train my own model. Steps: <br>
STEP 1: Creating a website where you can upload the Image and it counts number of objects and then as a human you can introduce your inputs to calculate (mAP). <br>
Running under server folder using docker instructions to run in my computer
STEP 2: Train own model to detect objects not present from previous model. <br>
